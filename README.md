# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. By analyzing customer features, the model identifies customers likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict customer churn using ANN.
- **Dataset**: [Churn_Modelling.csv](https://github.com/TulsiBasetti/customer-churn-prediction-using-ANN/blob/main/Churn_Modelling.csv)
- **Model**: ANN built with Keras.
- **Techniques**:
  - Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
  - Model Architecture: Input, hidden, and output layers with ReLU and Sigmoid activations.
  - Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset containing customer information.
- `customer-churn-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the ANN model.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TulsiBasetti/customer-churn-prediction-using-ANN.git
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook customer-churn-prediction.ipynb
   
## Model Performance

The ANN model achieved an accuracy of approximately **85%** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
